# â˜• Introduction to Java

Welcome to the **first step** of my Java learning journey in **JavArena**!  
In this section, weâ€™ll cover the **basics of Java**: what it is, why it's popular, and how to write your first Java program.


## ðŸ’¡ What is Java?

Java is a **high-level, object-oriented, platform-independent** programming language developed by **Sun Microsystems** (now owned by Oracle) in 1995.
Java is initiallyy called as OAK , The name  is inspired by the oak tree outside the Gosling's Office.
The name **java** take after indonesian java islands famous coffee java.

### ðŸ”‘ Key Features of Java:
- **Simple**: Easy to learn with clean syntax
- **Object-Oriented**: Everything is an object!
- **Platform-Independent**: Write once, run anywhere (WORA)
- **Secure**: No explicit pointers, runtime checking
- **Robust**: Strong memory management and exception handling
- **Multithreaded**: Built-in support for concurrent programming
- **Portable**: Code can run across devices with no changes


## ðŸ§  Java Editions

Java comes in three main editions:

Edition and it's Purpose 

 **JSE** (Standard Edition)  Core Java features for desktop apps 
 **JEE** (Enterprise Edition)  Web and enterprise development 
 **JME** (Micro Edition)  Mobile and embedded system development 



## ðŸ§© Java Components

1. **JDK (Java Development Kit)** â€“ Tools to develop Java programs
2. **JRE (Java Runtime Environment)** â€“ Environment to run Java apps
3. **JVM (Java Virtual Machine)** â€“ Runs bytecode and makes Java platform-independent

## How to compile and run Java Program

1.Write Code â€“ Save with **.java** extension
2.Compile â€“ **javac filename.java** â†’ Generates **.class** bytecode
3.Run â€“ **java filename** â†’ JVM executes the bytecode
