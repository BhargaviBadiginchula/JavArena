🚀 Java Aggregation – HAS-A Relationship

📌 What is Aggregation?

Aggregation is a special type of association in Object-Oriented Programming where one class contains a reference to another class.

👉 In simple terms, Object A HAS-A Object B.
For example:

A Student has an Address.

A Van has a Speed.

It represents a “whole–part” relationship but is considered weak compared to composition, because even if one object is deleted, the other can still exist independently.

🎯 Why Aggregation? (Purpose & Benefits)

✅ Promotes code reusability (use one class in multiple places).

✅ Reduces duplication of code.

✅ Improves modularity (separating different responsibilities).

✅ Supports loose coupling between classes.

💡 Real-World Use Cases

A Library has Books.

A Department has Professors.

A Bank has Employees.

A Company has Projects.

🔑 Key Notes

Aggregation expresses a HAS-A relationship.

It is a weak relationship compared to composition.

It improves modularity and reusability.

In OOP, the actual work may be delegated from one class to another without exposing details.
