# 🏦 Bank Account Management System – Java (Encapsulation Demo)

This project demonstrates **Encapsulation**, one of the core Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles in Java.

## 🔐 What is Encapsulation?
Encapsulation is the concept of wrapping data (variables) and code (methods) together in a single unit (class), while restricting direct access to internal fields. It enhances **data security**, **modularity**, and **code control**.

## 💡 Project Features
- Private fields: `accountHolderName`, `accountNumber`, `balance`, `PIN`
- Public methods (getters/setters) for controlled access
- PIN-protected balance view and withdrawals
- Validations for:
  - Invalid PIN
  - Insufficient balance
  - Negative deposits or withdrawals

## 🧪 Sample Operations
- View balance (with correct/incorrect PIN)
- Change PIN securely
- Deposit and withdraw amounts
- Get account details

## 🚀 How to Run
1. Clone the repo or copy the code.
2. Compile and run `BankAccount.java` using any Java IDE or terminal.
3. Outputs will show different edge cases handled securely.

## 📁 Files Included
- `Bank.java` – Main class implementing encapsulation
- `BankAccount.java` – Runner class with test cases
